**Senior Software Engineer**, *Palantir Technologies*                                                                             **October 2021-Present**

* Worked as a full-stack developer on the Foundry data connection team in order to build scalable data ingestion infrastructure to land external data into the platform	  
* Led a team of 5 other full-stack engineers, overseeing their technical development and performance with the goal of improving the stability of the Foundry data ingestion platform   
* Spearheaded an effort from design to implementation of Foundry’s [change-data-capture (CDC) ingestion capability](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/data-integration/change-data-capture/), allowing real-time data updates from source systems to Foundry’s Ontology eliminating the need for costly and time-consuming batch ingests  
* Led a project that delivered [150+ new source types to Foundry](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/announcements/2024-06/#over-150-new-sources-are-now-available-in-data-connection), optimizing the integration with an external vendor and maximizing partnership value by enabling seamless data ingestion from dozens of external data sources.   
* Developed the first-class [streaming ingestion capability](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/data-integration/streaming-guide/) with an accompanying SDK to enable Foundry to consume data from streaming sources such as Kafka, AWS Kinesis, and RabbitMQ  
* Created numerous first-class data connectors from scratch to ingest data from Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, Salesforce, and many other on-prem and cloud data sources into the platform in a scalable and maintainable way  
* Reduced the time required to bootstrap a new data connector frontend from 30-60 minutes to seconds by creating a code generation tool using Typescript and handlebars.js  
* Built a mission-critical well surveillance application for an oil and gas company in Foundry using Apache Flink and Kafka that is used company-wide in order to monitor well conditions and minimize revenue loss due to failures

**Software Development Engineer**, *Amazon*                                                                **August 2020-September 2021**

* Worked as a backend developer on the Alexa data platform team to build a widely used data product allowing internal users to query Alexa data to improve the product and make informed business decisions  
* Assisted in the development and design of a streaming data platform that delivers terabytes of Parquet format data daily to teams of 100+ data scientists and engineers using Kinesis, Kubernetes, and S3 resulting in over 10x query performance for customers  
* Independently developed an AWS Lambda service that onboards users to Alexa’s data platform and generates all resources required for users to receive and query data  
* Created a web application to allow customers to view dataset information using React and Javascript on the front end with Java and DynamoDB on a serverless AWS Lambda backend  
* Implemented a custom Apache Hudi application using Spark SQL to perform insert, update, and delete operations across hundreds of different parquet datasets located in S3 buckets
